**SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

***Preliminary Note***

*The Stock Purchase Agreement sets forth the basic terms of the purchase and sale of the preferred stock to the investors (such as the purchase price, closing date, conditions to closing) and identifies the other financing documents. Generally this agreement does not set forth either (1) the characteristics of the stock being sold (which are defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) or (2) the relationship among the parties after the closing, such as registration rights, rights of first refusal and co-sale, voting arrangements (these matters often implicate other persons than just the Company and the investors in this round of financing, and are usually embodied in separate agreements to which those others persons are parties, or in some cases by the Certificate of Incorporation). The main items of negotiation in the Stock Purchase Agreement are therefore the price and number of shares being sold, and the representations and warranties that the Company, and sometimes the Founders as well, must make to the investors.*

To the knowledge of the Company, no payment to be made under any 409A Plan is, or will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

Nevertheless, this rep is included here because it is in any case important that the issue be surfaced as part of the financing, to ensure that the company is mindful of the obligations and potential penalties imposed by 409A as it makes future equity grants. Inserting the rep in the first draft, as a discussion item, is one way to ensure that the issue is not neglected.*\]

3.  *Intellectual Property*. v\_field\_annotated\_copy \[**Subsection 2.8 gives the Purchasers assurances that the Company has the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct its business, or has disclosed its need to acquire further rights. Although Purchasers prefer an unqualified representation, this provision is often heavily negotiated, and may be impossible for the Company to make with certainty for a product in a very early stage of development. Under a common compromise, the Company provides an unqualified representation with respect to everything but patents, on the theory that potential patent conflicts cannot always be uncovered even after reasonable investigation, and that patent conflicts therefore represent an unknown risk that is fairly borne by both parties.**\] v\_field\_end v\_field\_include\_representation\_as\_to\_sufficient\_ip\_rights\_in\_company\_ip\_representation\_applicability The Company owns or possesses or v\_field\_include\_belief\_limitation\_in\_company\_ip\_representation\_as\_to\_ability\_to\_acquire\_sufficient\_ip\_rights\_applicability believes it v\_field\_end can acquire on commercially reasonable terms sufficient legal rights to all Company Intellectual Property without any known conflict with, or infringement of, the rights of others. v\_field\_end To the Company’s knowledge, no product or service marketed or sold (or proposed to be marketed or sold) by the Company violates or will violate any license or infringes or will infringe any intellectual property rights of any other party.

The Company has not received any communications alleging that the Company has violated, or by conducting its business, would violate any of the patents, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works or other proprietary rights or processes of any other Person. The Company has obtained and possesses valid licenses to use all of the software programs present on the computers and other software-enabled electronic devices that it owns or leases or that it has otherwise provided to its employees for their use in connection with the Company’s business. To the Company’s knowledge, it will not be necessary to use any inventions of any of its employees or consultants (or Persons it currently intends to hire) made prior to their employment by the Company.

In most cases, the Purchasers should be concerned primarily about use of third-party source code distributed under a license that requires the Company to disclose and distribute its own source code, that grants licensees rights under the Company’s patents, or that contains other provisions that relinquish or may compromise the Company’s intellectual property rights or commercial prospects. Much publicly available source code is distributed under licenses that permit it to be freely used and redistributed without imposing onerous obligations upon those that use it to develop their own software. Note also that the General Public License (“GPL”) and other so-called “viral” open source licenses impose potentially onerous obligations upon licensees only if code distributed under them is incorporated into a product that is actually released to the general public. Some proprietary software companies experiment with code distributed under the GPL during the development process with no intention of retaining GPL code in the products ultimately released to their customers. (This experimentation typically is done in a separate “branch” of the source code of a product in development.) The Company may wish to consider narrowing this representation to include use of third-party source code distributed under any license that imposes specified obligations upon the Company, and perhaps then only if the third party source code has been included in a product that the Company has released. An example of a reduced-disclosure open source representation is this one.”*\] v\_field\_end For purposes of this *Subsection 2.8*, the Company shall be deemed to have knowledge of a patent right if the Company has actual knowledge of the patent right or would be found to be on notice of such patent right as determined by reference to United States patent laws.

> \[*This representation is appropriate if there are foreign investors (i.e., nonresident aliens) involved in the financing, since they are subject to the Foreign Investment Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“**FIRPTA**”). Under FIRPTA, a transfer of an interest in a U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation (a “**USRPHC**”) by a foreign investor is subject to tax withholding, notwithstanding the general rule that sales of stock by foreigners are not subject to U.S. taxation. A corporation is USRPHC if more than fifty percent (50%) of its assets consist of U.S. real property. While very few, if any, venture capital investors are USRPHCs, it is customary to provide this representation in order to ensure that any foreign investors will not be subject to tax withholding.

\[*There is no consensus position on what should be included in the “Disclosure” representation. Purchasers will generally try to obtain an unqualified representation that none of the written information and business plan information provided to them by the Company contains a material misstatement or a materially misleading omission. The Company will generally try to resist such a broad representation, on the basis that a 10b-5 type representation, commonly found in an IPO prospectus, is inappropriate for a private financing in which a prospectus-type due diligence process has not occurred. The language shown represents a compromise position. It is important to note that the investors’ right of recovery for a breach of this rep may be broader than under Rule SEC 10b-5, because in order to prevail in a Rule 10b-5 securities fraud action, the purchaser must establish that the seller acted with scienter. That is, a purely innocent misrepresentation normally does not give rise to civil liability under 10b-5. Another issue for a Series A investor to consider is the relative utility of this rep to the Series A investor at this stage, versus the risk of giving such a broad rep to investors in later rounds (who, in a worst case, may be looking for a rep on which to “hang their hat” if they decide they want out of the investment).*\]

If (as is typically the case) the Agreement contemplates a simultaneous signing and closing, consider deleting Subsections 4.1 - 4.4, 4.6, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.17 (which, for the most part, can be covered by the representations in Section 2), and recasting the subsections of Section 4 as closing deliveries. If the Agreement contemplates multiple closings, attention should be given to determining what conditions must be satisfied in order to trigger the investors’ obligations to purchase shares at subsequent closings.**
>
> **Subsections 4.3 and 4.5 specifically require the Company to deliver at the Closing a Compliance Certificate and opinion of Company Counsel. In addition, it is generally necessary to deliver at the Closing (A) a Secretary’s certificate certifying the Company’s bylaws, board resolutions approving the transaction, and stockholder resolutions approving the Restated Certificate, (B) good standing certificates from the Secretary of State, (C) the certified Restated Certificate, and (D) waivers of any rights of first refusal triggered by the financing. These documents are therefore listed as “Closing Documents” on transaction checklists even though they are not specifically required to be delivered by the Agreement and are technically covered by the Compliance Certificate and the opinion of the Company’s counsel. If the transaction is structured as a simultaneous signing and closing, the closing conditions serve as a convenient closing checklist, but are significantly diminished in importance.**

In* Abry Partners V v. F&W Acquisition LLC, Case No. C.A. 1756-N (Del Ch. Ct.

However, it should be noted that if an action is brought in a jurisdiction other than the state whose governing law has been selected, that jurisdiction will apply its own choice of law principles in deciding whether or not to give effect to the governing law selected by the parties. Further, under the internal affairs doctrine of the state whose law is chosen to govern the agreement, whether or not the parties so provide, the DGCL will apply to certain provisions (e.g., voting of shares of stock).*\] v\_field\_end.
