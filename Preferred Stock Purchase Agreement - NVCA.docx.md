Section 1.2 provides for payment by check, wire transfer or cancellation of indebtedness. While wire transfers present the potential advantage of immediately available funds, closings can be delayed due to errors in the wire transfer process. Cancellation of indebtedness is often used when investors have provided the Company with a “bridge” loan to hold the Company over until the completion of this sale. See Chapter 15 regarding the specific form of bridge loan to be used. Also, note that signings and closings of venture financings are usually simultaneous.\]*

In subsequent financing rounds, consideration should be given as to whether the representations and warranties should be extended to prior issuances of Preferred Stock.*

On occasion, a venture capitalist may ask for a representation like the foregoing to assure that as of the date of investment the Company meets the requirements of Code Section 1202. The Company at times will resist this representation on the theory that the analysis regarding current compliance may be complex and, in any event, may not really benefit the investor because compliance with numerous other requirements during the period the investor holds the stock is needed for the investor to qualify for the benefits of Code Section 1202.\]*

This Agreement is made with such Investor in reliance upon such Investor’s representation to the Company, which by such Investor’s execution of this Agreement such Investor hereby confirms, that the Shares to be received by such Investor and the Conversion Shares (collectively, the “*Securities*”) will be acquired for investment for such Investor’s own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the distribution of any part thereof, and that such Investor has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. By executing this Agreement, such Investor further represents that such Investor does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such person or to any third person, with respect to any of the Securities.
    ==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

2.  *Disclosure of Information*. Such Investor believes it has received all the information it considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to purchase the Shares. Such Investor further represents that it has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the Company regarding the terms and conditions of the offering of the Shares and the business, properties, prospects and financial condition of the Company. The foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 2 of this Agreement or the right of the Investors to rely thereon.
    ==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

3.  *Investment Experience*. Such Investor is an investor in securities of companies in the development stage and acknowledges that it is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Shares. If other than an individual, Investor also represents it has not been organized for the purpose of acquiring the Shares.

It is, therefore, advantageous for the Company to limit its offering to these categories of investors, if feasible.\]*

*Restricted Securities*. Such Investor understands that the Securities will be characterized as “restricted securities” under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the Company in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities may be resold without registration under the Act, only in certain limited circumstances. In this connection, such Investor represents that it is familiar with SEC Rule 144, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Act.

    1.  There is then in effect a Registration Statement under the Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such Registration Statement; or
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) Such Investor shall have notified the Company of the proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and (ii) if reasonably requested by the Company, such Investor shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company that such disposition will not require registration of such shares under the Act. It is agreed that the Company will not require opinions of counsel for transactions made pursuant to Rule 144 except in unusual circumstances.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) above, no such registration statement or opinion of counsel shall be necessary for a transfer by an Investor that is a partnership to a partner of such partnership or a retired partner of such partnership who retires after the date hereof, or to the estate of any such partner or retired partner or the transfer by gift, will or intestate succession of any partner to his or her spouse or to the siblings, lineal descendants or ancestors of such partner or his or her spouse, if the prospective transferee agrees in all such instances in writing to be subject to the terms hereof to the same extent as if he or she were an original Investor hereunder.

If this Agreement provides for subsequent closings (as set forth in Section 1.3), counsel should consider which conditions should apply to both the initial closing and the subsequent closing. In particular, care should be taken to consider whether a legal opinion of company counsel should be delivered at a subsequent closing.*
